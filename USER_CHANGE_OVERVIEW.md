# User Change Overview (non-technical)

This is a short, plain-language summary of what changed in the Document Approval portal. Use this when talking to end users or customer support.

1) Pinned chat disclaimer
- A small message will appear at the top of the chat window: "This chat is not live. We aim to reply within 2 business days." Users can dismiss it with the × button. It will stay hidden after they close it.

2) Multi-journal selection (better navigation)
- After verifying, users now see a clear journal overview. If you have documents in multiple journals, you pick which journal to work in. This makes it easier to find the right documents.

3) PDFs render inline and won’t auto-download
- Clicking a document opens the PDF inside the page (viewer) rather than forcing a download. Download/Print buttons still work.

4) OTP flow improvements
- The system now handles pasted phone numbers better (won't duplicate country codes). Even if the email/phone isn't already in our system, the OTP step will proceed so users can verify.

5) UI polish and minor fixes
- Button placement and small layout updates for a cleaner UI. No major changes to where things are located.

If you want to include a short demo script for users, I can add 3 bullet steps to show them how to verify and open documents.
