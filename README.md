- Lambda: `ysu7eo2haj/prod` (no block approval)
- S3: Production bucket (no block approval)
- **Field Exists:** `Is_Approval_Blocked__c` ‚úÖ (created, not used)

#### Sandbox (my-sandbox)
- Salesforce: Block Approval LWC deployed ‚úÖ
- Apex: Block Approval methods deployed ‚úÖ
- **AI Chat:** Backed up to `sandbox-ai-backup-20251029-153054/`

## üéØ DEPLOYMENT ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Block Approval to Production (CURRENT)
**Goal:** Enable lawyers to block customer approvals when info is missing

**Tasks:**
- [x] Develop block approval feature
- [x] Test in sandbox
- [x] Create production deployment package
- [x] Document deployment process
- [ ] **Update SPA API endpoint to production**
- [ ] **Deploy to production Salesforce**
- [ ] **Deploy to production Lambda**
- [ ] **Deploy to production S3**
- [ ] **Validate in production**

**Deliverables:**
- Salesforce: Checkbox UI in Journal Documents component
- Lambda: Validation logic preventing blocked approvals
- SPA: Greyed buttons, warning icons, modal explanations

**Timeline:** 2-3 hours deployment + 24h monitoring

---

### Phase 2: Restore AI Chat to Test (AFTER PHASE 1)
**Goal:** Resume AI chat development in safe environment

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Verify Block Approval stable in production
- [ ] Restore AI version to sandbox from backup
- [ ] Deploy AI Lambda to test environment
- [ ] Deploy AI SPA to test S3
- [ ] Test complete system (Block Approval + AI Chat)

**Why Wait?**
- Avoid mixing untested AI features with production deployment
- Keep production deployment simple and low-risk
- Allow separate QA cycles for each feature

---

### Phase 3: Full System to Production (FUTURE)
**Goal:** Deploy complete system with all features

**Features Included:**
- ‚úÖ Block Approval (already in prod from Phase 1)
- ‚úÖ AI Chat with Claude 3.5 Haiku
- ‚úÖ PDF text extraction
- ‚úÖ DynamoDB conversation caching
- ‚úÖ Enhanced LWC UI (pills, better layout)
- ‚úÖ Improved SPA viewer

**Timeline:** TBD (after thorough testing)

## üîß FEATURE DETAILS

### Block Approval Feature

#### User Story
> As a lawyer, I want to prevent customers from approving documents when required information is missing, so that incomplete documents don't get approved prematurely.

#### Components

**Salesforce (LWC)**
- Checkbox: "Block Approval" (shows for non-approved docs)
- Visual indicator: Red tinted container for blocked documents
- Auto-save on toggle
- Hidden for already-approved documents

**Lambda (Python)**
- Query: Returns `isApprovalBlocked` field
- Validation: Skips approval if document is blocked
- Endpoints affected:
  - `/identifier/list`
  - `/doc-list`
  - `/identifier/approve`
  - `/approve`

**SPA (JavaScript)**
- Warning icon: ‚ö†Ô∏è on blocked documents in sidebar
- Tooltip: Translated message about missing info
- Greyed button: Visual indicator on approve button
- Modal: Explanation when clicking greyed button
- Translations: Danish, Swedish, English

#### Technical Implementation

**Salesforce Field:**
```
API Name: Is_Approval_Blocked__c
Type: Checkbox (Boolean)
Object: Shared_Document__c
Default: false
```

**Lambda Changes:**
- 7 additions across 4 functions
- SOQL queries include `Is_Approval_Blocked__c`
- Validation prevents API approval if blocked
- Returns status to frontend

**SPA Changes:**
- 3 functions modified in `app.js`
- 1 CSS class added for greyed buttons
- 12 translation strings added (4 per language)

## üíæ BACKUP STRATEGY

### Active Backups

#### AI Chat Version (sandbox-ai-backup-20251029-153054/)
**Created:** October 29, 2025 15:30:54  
**Purpose:** Preserve AI chat work while deploying Block Approval  
**Contents:**
- Complete Salesforce folder (LWC with AI chat)
- Lambda with Claude integration (2134 lines)
- SPA with chat UI and enhancements
- All configuration files

**Restore When:** After Block Approval stable in production

#### Production Baseline (prod-version/)
**Created:** Earlier in project  
**Purpose:** Reference for production state  
**Contents:**
- Original production Lambda
- Original production SPA files
- Original Salesforce components

**Use Case:** Comparison, rollback reference

---

## üîÑ GIT WORKFLOW

### Branch Strategy
**Main Branch:** Contains all versions and documentation  
**No Feature Branches:** Using directory-based versioning instead

### Directory-Based Versioning
- `block-approval-clean/` = Production-ready block approval
- `vscode attempt/` = Development version (AI chat)
- `sandbox-ai-backup-*/` = Point-in-time backups
- `prod-version/` = Production baseline

### Commit Strategy
- Commit frequently during development
- Tag production deployments
- Include deployment notes in commits
